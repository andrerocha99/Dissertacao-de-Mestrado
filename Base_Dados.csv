"#VALUE!","2014","1/18/2014","6:15","Noturno ","-8.6833333333333","13.25","Angola","A crude oil tanker was reported missing from Luanda anchorage on 18 Jan 2014 and suspected to be hijacked by pirates. All communications with the tanker had been lost. On 26 Jan 2014 the Master made contact with the owners reporting that the tanker had been released and that the pirates had stolen a large amount of cargo. It approximately had about 81 million CBM of Diesel on board. The pirates arrived on a tug called Gare and it was estimated that they headed South Malabo and Sao Tome with the hijacked tanker. One crew was reported injured during the hijacking. In the early hours of 18 January 2014 a 75,000-ton tanker, the MT Kerala, vanished off the coast of Angola. A sophisticated pirate gang hijacked the Greek-owned vessel, disabling its identifications system and communication equipment, and painting over its identifying markers.More than a week later and 1,300 miles away, the hijackers released Kerala off the coast of Nigeria, after offloading 12,270 tons of its diesel cargo to other ships.The Kerala hijacking marks the southernmost expansion of Nigeria’s pirate gangs, but represents only one subset of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. The waters of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea each suffered pirate attacks in the first week of 2014.Off Nigeria the epicenter of western Africa piracy there have been at least 12 attacks against various types of vessels this year, resulting in multiple kidnappings. Within the swampy maze of the Niger Delta, militants-cum-pirates have robbed passenger vessels, kidnapped oil workers and ambushed security-force patrols.This level of organized piracy as distinguished from opportunistic robberies against berthed and anchored vessels—can be sorted into two different categories: tanker hijackings for product theft and maritime kidnapping for ransom.Both forms are intertwined with the regional oil industry, but their distinct perpetrators, targets, and trend lines warrant separate looks. First, tanker hijackings.Tanker hijackings aimed at large-scale cargo theft first appeared off Benin in December 2010 and spread to the waters of Nigeria, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, and Angola in subsequent years. This western Nigeria-based criminal enterprise is highly organized and intelligence driven, allegedly with the involvement of high-powered political, business, and military patrons. As a suspected hijacker captured near Lagos explained:“We do not work in isolation. We have a network of ministries’ workers. What they do is to give us information on the location and content of the vessels to be hijacked. Once we complete the assignment, we would inform the pointsmen who thereafter, contact the cabal that takes charge of the hijacked vessels. We usually meet at a designated point on the high sea, from where they would offload the contents from the hijacked vessels and thereafter, deposit them in various oil facilities for distribution by oil marketers.”The pirates who hijacked Kerala targeted the ship based on foreknowledge of its cargo, location and intended movements. Using a stolen tugboat as a “mother ship,” the hijackers made a multiday voyage all the way to a Luanda anchorage and then selected their target from some 30 other vessels in the area.After hijacking the ship, the pirates sailed towards the Republic of Congo where they made their first sale of stolen diesel. The hijackers later made two more ship-to-ship transfers off the southwest coast of Nigeria before abandoning Kerala on 26 January.If the pirates sold the diesel for half of its $10 million market price, they and their sponsors netted some $5 million in na operation that lasted just over a week.The geographic scope of this particular crime demonstrates the expansive multinational network of informants and buyers hijack syndicates employ. While the leadership of the gangs is Nigerian, they are thought to recruit regionally, as indicated by the testimony of captured pirates and reports of pirates speaking both English and French during attacks","AGO","24","KERALA","Tanker","Libéria","Navegar","7","Mar Territorial","HIJACK/ROUBO","6","UNK","1","1","10","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At around 5:45am  a Maltese-flagged tanker named MT COTTON with 24 Indians crew members on board was taken hostage by 20 Nigerians pirates. The tanker was filled up with petroleum residue couple days before by SOGARA ship and was waiting for the next tour of refilling when Nigerians pirates hijacked it. The pirates used a speedboat equipped with two engines of 250 HP to operate. Once on board the pirates deactivated the tanker navigation system such as the tag boat GPS telephone and radio communication. Fortunately the captain of the tanker was able to send couple of messages out before the pirates got on board. The tankers tag boat was found activated in the ocean. No tanker and no pirates were found when Gabon Law Enforcement arrived in the area. According to a message received by Gabonese authorities the COTTON Tanker is localized somewhere in Nigeria. Pirates have freed the oil product tanker Cotton and all 24 Indian crew members on 22 July 2013 off Nigeria. All crew safe. The information is from the vessels operator. Director general of shipping, Mumbai, Gautam Chatterjee said MT Cotton was released at 8.20pm IST. All the crew members aboard were reported safe; no one was in need of immediate medical assistance, Chatterjee said.
